📜 Move Rules

You can only place a card on a card one rank higher.
For example: a 5 can be placed on a 6, a Jack (J) on a Queen (Q)

You can only move a group of cards if they are in sequence and of the same suit.
For example: 7♠ 6♠ 5♠ – can be dragged together
But 7♠ 6♥ 5♠ – cannot (different suits in the middle)

You can place any card or group of cards on an empty column.

When all the face-down cards in a column are removed, the top face-down card is automatically flipped over.

📦 Deal from the Deck

Click the "Deal" button (or the deck below) to deal 1 card to each of the 10 columns.
⚠️ Important: You can only deal if all columns are occupied (none are empty).
There are 5 deals (50 cards) in the deck.

✅ Complete Sequence

When a complete sequence of K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-A of the same suit is formed in the column below, it is automatically removed from the table, and you receive +100 points.

Each Move: -1 point
Completed Sequence: +100 points

💡 Tips for Beginners

Start with 1 suit—it's easier to understand the mechanics.
Try to reveal face-down cards—this gives you more options for moves.
Complete sequences of the same suit—only sequences of the same suit can be moved as a group.
Don't rush to deal from the deck—first, make all possible moves on the board.
Free up columns wisely—an empty column is useful as temporary storage.
Use hints if you get stuck—the Hint button will help you.

Good luck! 🕷️🃏
